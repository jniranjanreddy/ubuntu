sudo apt update && sudo apt -y upgrade

sudo apt install open-vm-tools-desktop
sudo apt install net-tools
sudo apt install git 
sudo apt install python3-virtualenv
```
## Create a directory called virtual and then create a virtual environment within that directory called awx.
```
mkdir virtual 
cd virtual 
virtualenv awx
```
## Activate the virtual environment.
source awx/bin/activate

## Install Docker
```
sudo apt -y install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
docker version 
```
## Install Docker Compose
pip3 install docker-compose

## Clone the AWX repository from GitHub, make sure you go to your home directory before doing this otherwise you will get an error saying the folder awx already exists.
```
git clone -b 17.0.1 https://github.com/ansible/awx.git
Edit the Inventory file
You now have a folder called awx and within there a folder called installer and within there an inventory file you need to edit.

You just need to make sure you have set an admin password and we need to change the directory of your virtual environment.

Uncomment and change # admin_password=password to your password like so

admin_password=(your secure password)
Find the AWX custom virtual environment folder. Only usable for local install.

custom_venv_dir=/opt/my-envs/ and change the path to /home/joakimnordin/virtual/awx but make sure you change to your username, not my username obviously.
```
